    <p class="summary">
      Rigved is the oldest, longest and most important document in Indian
      history. Rigveda is all about the grand things for kings, order,
      sacrifices, havanas, rhymes to praise Gods. Rigved mainly foucus on
      <b>Indra</b> the thunder God and his worrior nature that put the
      foundation of what we call our <b>Indian Civilization</b>.
    </p>

  <p class="info">
    Ved's aren't that easiest document to understand cause they're written
    in <b>Vedic Sanskrit</b> which is difficult than sanskrit taught in
    schools. It's lot more older and lot more complex <br>
    Take for example

  <p class="information">Even if you know basic Sanskrit it's hard to grasp knowdlege of Vedas. Also we as humans love
    stories and can relate and learn from them to apply in our life that's why <b>Ramayana</b> and <b>Mahabharata</b>
    are popular among common people.</p>

  <p class="info">It's also a thing that for most part of history it was forbidden for some people to listen to
    <b>Vedas</b>, let alone study them.

      If a Shudra listens to the recitation of the Vedas (with the desire to learn the alphabet), his ears should be
      filled with molten lead and zinc; if he utters a letter of the Vedas (along with the twice-born), his tongue
      should be cut off; and if he chants the Vedic mantras, his body should be cut into pieces.

  <p class="information">But let's clarify something. All there are de additions and in actual Vedas you don't see
    such harsh
    language</p>
  <p class="information">Also these lines should'nt be taken as they are. These are mianly added to enhance poetic
    effects
    and to make fear in people so none can corroupt them. Think about it Veds are the only surviving document on
    entire <b>Indo-European</b> cultures
    <br>It's really a great feat in itself to maintain them in original states dispite invasion. You'd be shocked to
    know how sofisticated system was developed for this.

    <p class="information">There wasa a elabrate system developed to preserve Veds. Entire families were dedicated to
      memorize sections of Veds and each family is called <b>"Shakha"</b>
      <br> In shakha's children were taught to chant verses in various ways. Today the Ved you can order online are
      composed by integrating the knowdlege of multiple families across generations. <br>
      This was like a decentralized human bloackchain system so that any part can't be corroupt and even if some part is
      missing it can be recovered. <br> Let's see the first verse of Rigved ie. <b>Agni Suktam</b>
